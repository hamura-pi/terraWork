Folder structure:
1. 3ds max file - there is zip archive with 3ds max files for each bug.
2. AlienBugs - main folder. contains all models, textures and materials. 
3. DemoScene - this folder contais files only related to the demo scene. In general there are only scripts. You can use them if you need or you can completely ignore this folder.
4. Prefabs - this folder contans prefabs, used in the demo. You can ignore this folder too, or you can use them in your project if you like.


Scripts:
This pack is a 3d model pack. So all programming was made very quickly just to demonstrate these models. All scripts were made just to work. So there are no any comments or good structure in these scripts. But ofcourse you can use any script from DemoScene folder in your projects if you like.


Textures:
All textures are 1024x1024. Duffuse maps have two versions: the first is a simple diffuse and the second is diffuse + specular in alpha channel. Also specular map is included as a separate file.

Explosions:
All bugs except 301 and 302 can be exploded. The explosions of bugs are included in the pack. All explosion pieces have explosion animation, so no physics is required. But anyway you can disable animation in the import settings and create physics based explosion.

Mobile platform:
This pack is a result of develpment of mobile game, so it is absolutely compatable with android and iOS. It was tested on galaxy s1 with 25 bugs on screen. If you are going to use it for mobile platforms, you need to adjust texture import settings (mostly resolution) and set all materials to use "Mobile" shaders. 


3ds max files:
All models were made in 3ds max 2012 product update 10. Caracter Animation Toolkit was used for rigging and animating. 
All files have the same structure: model itself, rig, explosion parts, text with animation frames.
Bug_301 was rigged with custom bones and complicated system of helpers and scripts. But it is easy enough to animte these rig using helpers.
